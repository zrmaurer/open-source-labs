2.It is important to choose a license in order to be sure your work is being used in accordance with your needs, and proper credit is due. For examples, a project that used a "copyleft" license has the goal to ensure derivitives of the project also follow free software rules

3.It is important to avoid projects without an explicit license because by default they are very protected. The creator can restrict and refuse your right to use the project and even get you into legal trouble.

4.The fall of gopher is a good example of the community turning away from a good product because of it's restrictive policies. Even if wanting to make money of their idea isn't inherently bad, their closed nature made the community at large lose trust in the project.

5.Android being open source allows different phone manufactures and hobbyists to create their own versions according to their needs and preferences. The source is not copyleft, allowing manufacturers to decide how they license their version and hardware. The kernal is copyleft in accordance with linux philosophy. The need for android branding allows google to make money off of the code while keeping it open for smaller developers and hobbyists.

6.For a simple phone app, such as a podcast aggregator and player, the GNU GPL would work best. Patenting shouldn't be an issue, but modifications of your code having a restricted license might be worrysome.

7.The GPL ensures that derivitives are well documented and use the same license. The LGPL is similar, but applications that use libraries under LGPL don't need to used the LGPL. The Apache License is very permissive, but the contributers maintain patent writes to their code.

   Developers would probably used LGPL so that people can use and modify your code in a variety of places, but only restrict the lisence if they are using the code inside another project. Apache license is good for companies because it retains patent rights. For the common good, GPL would ensure code is used, modified, and shared under an open license.

9.For the podcast example above, I already explained that a GPL would work best. If I were to work on this project, I would take only one or two other people. It is simple enough that more people wouldn't be necissary.
