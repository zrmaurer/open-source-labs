What I got out of Chapter 3 of Free Culture

While I had always known that the RIAA had a history of punishing young adults heavily for percieved piracy, I had not heard of this particular instance. In this case they weren't even going after a file hoster, but the man who made the search engine. This is absurd on all levels and it is no wonder that Jesse became an activist due to it. The fact that the RIAA can do this is a clear example of our copyright and communication laws are outdated by technology. I understand the need to protect properties, but these cases are far removed from the plight of artists and creators.
